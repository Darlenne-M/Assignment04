# Assignment04

This is the last individual assignment :)

You are required to design and develop a full stack web application that stores data persistently in a database and displays it on a web client. This app will be built on top of the CRUD API that you made for Assignment 3. This app will do the exact same thing that your API does, except all the requests will be coming from a web browser, and responses displayed as web pages.
